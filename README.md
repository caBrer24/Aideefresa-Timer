# Aideefresa Timer
This a project was made for and with a very special person in mind. A timer implementing the "Pomodoro" technique with some additional features such as pictures of the user's choice to look at a glance when working and motivational quotes or affirmation phrases during the two stages of the app--While working or at break. The very special person mentioned before gets motivated when looking at things they love or/and finds beatiful, that's the why of the pictures. As far as the phrases/quotes, those are true words coming from my heart in a attempt to see this person reach their full potential during "go time" There are some features that didn't make it, like being able to change the background color, or theme in general. That was because of who was going to use this app and bottom line; personal preference. This app was made using Kivy 2.2.1, Kivy MD 1.1.1, as well as the Kivy language.

NOTE: Generic images and labels were used instead of the originals due to the original elements being personal.
