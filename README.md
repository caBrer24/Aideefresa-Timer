# Aideefresa Timer
This a project was made for and with a very special person in mind, therefore, it might not be to everybody's liking. A timer implementing the "Pomodoro" technique with some additional features such as pictures of the user's choice to look at a glance when working, and motivational quotes or affirmation phrases during the two stages of the app--While working or at break. The very special person mentioned before gets motivated when looking at things they love or/and finds beatiful, that's the why of the pictures. As far as the phrases/quotes, those are true words coming from my heart in a attempt to see this person reach their full potential during "go time" There are some features that didn't make it, like being able to change the background color, or theme in general. That was because of who was going to use this app and personal preference. This app was made using Kivy 2.2.1, Kivy MD 1.1.1, as well as the Kivy language, and converted into an .APK through GitHub Actions with Buildozer.

**Main interface; picture displayed in the middle with three buttons at the top (Originally, each button contains a category of pictures, which are displayed when their respective buttons are activated), the "start and "reset" buttons at the bottom. Double tap on the reset button will take the user back to the first screen, where they are able to adjust their work and break time as seen necessary. There are customizable labels on each side of the screen and the timer itself at the bottom center.**
